# Blackjack game rules

The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total card value of 21. Player competes only against the dealer.

## Card Values 

- Number cards (2 to 10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, bit for simplicty in this game they are worth 11. 

## Gameplay
1. **Initial Deal**: The player and the dealer receive two face-up cards.

2. **Player's Turn**: The player has the following options:
    - **Hit**: Take an additional card from the deck to increase the total value of their hand.
    - **Stand**: Keep the current hand and end their turn.

3. **Dealer's Turn**: After a player has completed their turn, the dealer must:
    - hit on a hand totaling 16 or less
    - stand on a hand totaling 17 or more

4. **Winning and Losing**:
    - If the player's total exceeds 21, they "bust" and automatically lose the round.
    - If the dealer busts and the player does not, the player wins.
    - If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the hand with the highest total value (up to 21) wins.
    - If the player's and dealer's hands have the same value, it's a "push," and the player keeps their bet without winning additional money.

5. **Blackjack**: If a player's first two cards are an Ace and a 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, or King), they have a "Blackjack" or a "Natural." This typically pays out at a higher rate than a regular win.

6. **Insurance**: If the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, players have the option to take insurance against the dealer having a Blackjack. Insurance costs half the original bet and pays 2 to 1 if the dealer does have Blackjack.

7. **Surrender**: In some variations, players may have the option to surrender and forfeit half of their bet if they believe their hand is weak.

## Winning and Payouts
- Winning regular hands (non-Blackjack) pays 1 to 1, meaning you win an equal amount to your bet.
- Winning with a Blackjack typically pays 3 to 2, meaning you win 1.5 times your bet.
